Hi! I am a **third-year Ph.D. student** in the [**Department of Computer Science and Engineering**](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at [**University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) **(UMN)**. I am grateful to be co-advised by <a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~interran/" style="color: #c98f14;font-weight: bold;">Dr. Victoria Interrante</a> and <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/evan-suma-rosenberg" style="color: #c98f14;font-weight: bold;">Dr. Evan Suma Rosenberg</a>. 

Before enrolling in the Ph.D. program at UMN, I was in the **M.Sc.** program in [**Computer Science**](https://cse.umn.edu/cs) at UMN, and I received my **B.Sc.** in [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/) at [**Stony Brook University**](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). 

My research interests focus on addressing challenges and enhacing user interaction experience in **virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality(AR)**.
